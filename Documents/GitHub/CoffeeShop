# Use idiomatic python and Object-Oriented techniques to create a program that models some 
# aspect of a coffee shop. You can decide what aspects you want to represent in your program, 
# but you should make use of at least 3 object constructors, and show how the objects interact. 
# Be prepared to talk about the decisions you made, and the reasoning for those decisions.
